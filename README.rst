Layer Enforcer
==============

Layer Enforcer is a tool for linting your imports within the project.

The tool was designed to help maintain following order of things:

* Dependencies always flow towards root of the tree. Often this is ``domain``
  layer.
* Dependencies may skip layers, as long as they flow in same direction.
  For instance, your ``web`` layer may import use cases from ``domain`` layer.
* Infer layer from imports or module names. Say, if you import ``fastapi``
  anywhere on the chain, the module is assigned to ``web`` layer, or maybe you
  want ``models`` to always be ``db`` layer.
* Flexible layer structure. Preferably defined via config file.
* Code is packaged by component. I.e. single component may contain code from
  the different layers.

Be warned, since this might not the best fit for you.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install layer-enforce

For Development
---------------

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -e .[test,lint]

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: sh

    layer-enforcer myproject myotherproject --layers layers.yaml


layers.yaml
-----------

An example of clean-architecture-ish layer layout for typical web app:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: domain
    submodules: ["entities", "use_cases"]
    layers:
    - name: service
      submodules: ["services"]
      layers:
      - name: infrastructure
        imports: ["stripe", "requests", "passlib"]
        layers:
        - name: db
          imports: ["sqlalchemy", "psycopg2", "alembic"]
          submodules: ["models", "memory", "database"]
        - name: web
          imports: ["fastapi", "jose"]
          submodules: ["views", "schemas"]
        - name: tasks
          imports: ["celery"]
          submodules: ["tasks"]
